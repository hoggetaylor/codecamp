# Asteroids

## Week 1

- Game Loop
- Draw the player
- Move the player (maybe)

## Week 2

- Finish player movement
- Randomly spawn in asteroids that float around

## Week 3

- Collision detection between player and asteroids

## Week 4

- Add player's gun to shoot down asteroids

## Ideas

- Varying levels of difficulty.
    Easy: asteroid every 20 seconds
    Medium: asteroid every 10 seconds
    Hard: asteroid every 5 seconds
    Extra Hard: asteroid every second + solar flare
